			The paper gives information about Context-Aware recommender application with its data structure implemented in Ontology. The basic idea here is to recommend the user of the application places and services according to his/her preferences and/or context. Ontology is a way of representing data in the form of concepts in a particular domain and the relationships between those concepts.

			The next generation of computing belongs to context aware applications. These applications running in the background are invisible and calm. With advances in mobile networks and hi-speed connectivity it becomes a lot easier to track a user and identify his context. The location of a user can be tracked either with the help of GPS or by cellular network service provider. Our application aims to identify the user location and accordingly switch the mode of userâ€™s smart device.
